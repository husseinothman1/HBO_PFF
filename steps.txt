1 -- initialize the node js project with default setting  for server
npm init -y  

2 --add the  below 2 lines to package.json
    "start": "node server.js" ,
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"
    -- Runs your app using plain Node.js
          "start": "node index.js"

      --Start the development server with auto-reload
        "dev": "nodemon server.js"

3 -- change  to 
   "main": "server.js",

4 -- create the server.js

5 -- npm install express mysql cors nodemon  multer
    --express: Web framework for Node.js
                 Simplifies creating web servers and APIs
                 Handles routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests)
                 Manages middleware (functions that process requests)
                 Makes HTTP server setup much easier than raw Node.js

    --mysql: MySQL database driver for Node.js
             Connects your Node.js app to MySQL database
             Executes SQL queries
             Manages database connections   

    -- corse: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware
              Allows your frontend (running on one port) to communicate 
              with your backend (running on another port).
              Prevents browser security errors
              Controls which domains can access your API      

    -- nodemon: Development tool that auto-restarts your server
                Watches your files for changes
                Automatically restarts Node.js when you save
                Saves you from manually stopping/starting server     

   -- multer : used for uploading files
               Handles file uploads from forms
               Saves files to disk or memory
               Validates file types and sizes
               Works with Express.js

// on error frontend --> npm install --save-dev cross-env

express → creates a web server and API routes.

mysql → allows Node.js to connect and interact with MySQL databases.

cors → enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing frontend apps (like Angular or React) to call this backend from another domain or port.

multer → used for file uploads (though not used yet in your code).

path → helps manage file paths (used with multer or file handling).
